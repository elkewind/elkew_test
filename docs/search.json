    "text": "Introduction\nGlobal human activity threatens many species with extinction. According to the International Union and Conservation of Nature (IUCN), “More than 41,000 species are threatened with extinction. That is still 28% of all assessed species.” [1]. Increased extinction and loss of biodiversity can have severe ecological, economic, and cultural impacts. Cardinale et al.’s deep dive into biodiversity and ecosystem services research conclude that biodiversity loss reduces ecological communities’ efficiency, stability, and productivity. Decreased productivity from ecosystem services can have a negative impact on ecosystem economics [2]. Additionally, cultures worldwide have strong ties to local flora and fauna, much of which now face extinction risk. Improving understanding of extinction risk is ecologically, economically, and culturally important.\nWildlife scientists have been working to understand what ecological traits of vertebrates predict threat level, and what common risk factors drive those threat level rates. Munstermann et al. investigate what terrestrial vertebrate functional groups are most at risk of extinction threat and find that cave dwelling amphibian, arboreal quadrupedal mammals, aerial and scavenging birds, and pedal squamates are at high risk [3]. This knowledge can help inform policies and practices with the goal to decrease threats of extinction of wildlife. However, less comprehensive research has been done to conduct similar analyses on marine species.\nIn recent years, the waters surrounding the Hawaiian Islands have been exposed to ecological changes due to mass coral bleaching events, El Niño events, and pollution. Rapidly changing marine ecosystems may pose a threat to Hawaiian fish. Fish hold significant cultural value in Hawaiʻi, and many local people rely on seafood as a major source of protein. However, approximately 72% of fish in Hawaiʻi present in FishBase have been evaluated by the IUCN and have sufficient data to be assessed. Here I run a small-scale analysis to investigate Hawaiian fish ecological traits – such as endemism, size, and reef-association – to predict a binary status on the IUCN red list and predict which unevaluated fish species in Hawaiʻi may be threatened.\n\n\n\nVarious fish found in Hawaiʻi.

    "text": "Data\nFor my analyses I use the IUCN Red List data accessed via the IUCN Red List API [1] and package rredlist [4]. Consistent with Munstermann et al., living species listed as ‘Vulnerable’, ‘Endangered’, or ‘Critically Endangered’ were categorized as ‘Threatened’. Living species listed as ‘Least Concern’ and ‘Near Threatened’ were categorized as ‘Nonthreatened’ [3]. Extinct species were not evaluated in this analysis. The IUCN Red List data are limited in that many marine species have not been listed yet or have been identified as too data deficient to be evaluated. The lack of data on elusive fish may introduce bias into the model.\nFish ecological data were accessed from FishBase [5] via package rfishbase [6]. Different species in the FishBase data were originally described by different people, possibly leading to errors or biases. Measurement errors in length may be present, as there are various common ways to measure the length of a fish. The species recorded in FishBase may be biased towards fish with commercial value. Data were wrangled in R and formatted in a tidy data table (Table 1.)\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntab_df(tidy_fish_data[1:5,],\n       title = \"Tbl 1.

    "text": "Methods\nHere I run a logistic regression with a categorical binary response variable of ‘Threatened’ or ‘Nonthreatened’ on species length, coral reef association, and endemism.\nI included length in the model because previous research show that species of extreme sizes have higher risk of extinction. Ripple et al. “found that the probability of being threatened was positively and significantly related to body mass for birds, cartilaginous fishes, and mammals” [7]. While body mass is not the same as length, the FishBase data set had few weight entries and many length entries, and sample size was already limited. Several mass coral bleaching events have occurred in Hawaiʻi in recent decades causing ecosystem disruption [8]. Here I consider if reef-associated fish are more likely to be threatened than fish that are not reef-associated. Last, endemic species – species that are native to a region and occur only in that region – are known to be at high risk of extinction."

    "text": "Limitations & Next Steps\nAs mentioned above, both the IUCN Red List data and the FishBase data have potential biases and don’t evaluate all species. Additionally, not all listed species had every piece of information, and missing data were removed. With missing data removed, the sample became small. It is possible that endemism plays a bigger role in threat risk than illustrated here by the model. Points of concern with this model include disproportionate data in both the threat level and endemism, and high false negative rates in binary prediction. Future analyses could investigate other potential explanatory variables such as metrics measuring fishing pressure, life cycle characteristics, and range. Future analyses should also incorporate indigenous knowledge as Native People in Hawaiʻi know fish history around the islands and are frequently in the water for spearfishing and other recreation. Additionally, future analyses could expand the area of interest to all of the tropics.\n\nReference\n\n[1] “IUCN,” IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

    "text": "A bit more about who I am, what I do, where I’ve been, and where I’m headed\n\n\n\nFull BioHobbiesHomesWhat’s Next\n\n\n\nBiography\n\nI am a master’s student studying Environmental Data Science in the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I earned my bachelor’s degree in Biology in 2020 from Iowa State University with a curriculum focus on animal ecology. During my undergraduate studies, I sought out opportunities to connect animal ecology with my passion for marine conservation. I took hands-on marine coursework at the University of Hawaii at Hilo, California State University Monterey Bay, and the University of Southern Mississippi’s Gulf Coast Research Laboratory.\nAfter graduating, I completed a 400-hour Animal Behavior Fellowship at the Virginia Aquarium & Marine Science Center. During the fellowship, I implemented the use of Zoo Monitor - a behavior tracking tool - to monitor harbor seal and American crow behavior. Additionally, my undergraduate capstone project assessed using new technologies (autonomous recording units and Raven Pro sound analysis software) to replace traditional field techniques when monitoring quail coveys. I became enthusiastic about data science when processing data from Zoo Monitor and Raven Pro. My long-term goal is to use data science to inform effective marine wildlife conservation and fisheries management.\nMy interests include:\n\nMarine & wildlife conservation\nRemote sensing & geospatial ecology\nFisheries sustainability\nEnvironmental Justice\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Hobbies!\n\nWhat do I do outside of the office and classroom? I love hiking, biking, swimming, and generally spending time outdoors. You can frequently catch me reading a book, and it’s most likely a mystery/thriller novel (find me on Goodreads!) I spend a lot of time in the kitchen cooking and baking – I picked up these two hobbies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Last, I dabble in digital illustration, graphic design, and photography. I have been selling prints and stickers since 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Homes\n\nI grew up in the state of Iowa, but I’ve moved around a lot in my adult life! I participated in multiple National Student Exchange programs, and I moved around for internships and fellowships. Check out all the places I’ve lived since I started college in 2016 – size indicates relatively how long I lived there:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap made using package leaflet and data from: https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities\n\n\n\nWhat’s Next for Me?\n\nRight now I am focusing on finishing my Master’s degree and anticipate graduating in June 2023. I will be looking to start work next summer as a data scientist! Broadly, I hope to find a role where I can blend my creative and quantitative talents to contribute to an organization or research group focused on wildlife conservation or fisheries sustainability. I am ideally looking for jobs in Washington, Oregon, California or Hawaii."

    "section": "Discussion",
    "text": "Discussion\n\nData exploration:\nAfter aligning the FishBase data with the IUCN Red List data, the data are disproportionate in both the threat level (Table 2) and endemism (Table 4). Fish length is skewed right (Figure 1), and reef-association is well balanced (Table 3).\n\n\nAnalysis:\nHere we see that longer fish are associated with higher probability of being threatened (Table 5, p-value = <0.001), but two outliers may be driving this significance (Figure 2). However, when the outliers are removed, we still see a significant positive correlation between fish length and probability of threat (Table 6, p-value = <0.001) with the 50% probability mark remaining just over 400 cm (Figure 3). When we compute the odds ratio, we see that there is an exponential relationship between the length and the odds of a species being threatened. Odds of being threatened increase more at large lengths (Figure 4).\nThe accuracy of the model is 97% with 847 out of 874 predicted observations being correct (Table 7). However, the model seems to be more accurate in predicting species that are not actually of concern (true negative rate = 0.99). Species that are threatened have poorer prediction rates (true positive rate = 0.38).\nWe can see from the output above that length remains significant (Table 8, p-value = <0.001) even when additional variables are added, making length robust. Endemicity is a significant predictor of threat probability at a significance level of 0.10 (p-value = 0.0707). Coral reef association is not significantly impacting the model (p-value = 0.9175).\n\n\nPredicting Probability:\nIn this model, the smallest fish in the data set – Melamphaes danae at 2.30 cm – has a probability of being threatened of 0.012. The largest fish in the data set – Rhincodon typus at 1700 cm – has a probability of being threatened of 0.99."

    "text": "The purpose of this blog is to explore ways to use the MCD15A3H Version 6.1 data product produced by MODIS instruments on board the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)’s Terra and Aqua satellites. MCD15A3H contains data on Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) and Leaf Area Index (LAI), both dimensionless characteristics of plant canopy structure. FPAR refers to the fraction of incoming solar radiation (400−700 nm) that is absorbed by the green entities of a plant canopy, and LAI refers to the amount of leaf material in a plant canopy that is estimated as the one-sided green leaf area per unit ground surface area in a broadleaf canopy and as the one−half of the total needle surface area per unit ground area in a coniferous canopy.\nIn this blog, we present examples for accessing the data product using Google Earth Engine and reading FPAR and LAI data into a Jupyter notebook. We provide code to access the bands and create histogram and time series plots as well as two use case examples to compare and contrast these metrics. Others can extend this analysis to evaluate differences between LAI and FPAR in order to identify areas of low LAI and high FPAR – indicating highly efficient canopies – or high LAI and low FPAR – indicating less efficient canopies. However, these calculations are beyond the scope of this blog and not illustrated here. Instead, we focus on how FPAR and LAI, separately, have spatially changed over time in the Lacandon Jungle.\n\n\n\nThe Lacandon Jungle is Maya land and is one of the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world (Levinson 2017). This area is of interest because it is experiencing significant tropical deforestation due to slash-and-burn farming, logging, and cattle raising (Levinson 2017). From 2000 to 2012, 6 percent of the total forest area was lost, or around 500 million trees and more than 32 million tons of biomass (Soberanes 2018). Whatsmore, large climate variability (like the rate of occurrence of events of drought) has affected the jungle’s role in directly influencing the local, regional, and even global climate (O’Brien 2008)."

    "section": "Dataset Description",
    "text": "Dataset Description\nThe MCD15A3H (Version 6.1) data product observes vegetation canopy structure and soil patterns via Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors on the Terra and Aqua satellites, and is published and mantained by NASA since July 4, 2002 (Myneni, Knyazikhin, & Park 2021). Terra’s orbit around the Earth is set so that it covers the Equator from north to south in the morning at an altitude of 698 km and Aqua covers it from south to north in the afternoon at an altitude of 705 km. Thus, this data product has a global spatial extent and generated at a 500 meter spatial resolution in a Sinusoidal projection. In addition, the MCD15A3H data product is generated at two temporal resolutions: a 8-day compositing period and a 4-day compositing period (Myneni, Knyazikhin, & Park 2021). Here, we use the a 4-day composite data product.\nThe file format of this data product is HDF-EOS (Hierarchical Data Format - Earth Observing System). This is a self-describing data format that is used for NASA EOS satellites, which include Terra, Aqua, and Aura. Beyond the HDF metadata, there is also an ECS .met file (XML format) available containing a portion of the HDF metadata.\nThe MCD15A3H data product can be retrieved via NASA Earthdata Search, USGS EarthExplorer, OPeNDAP, and Google Earth Engine. Here, we retrieve the data product via Google Earth Engine given the API’s effectiveness to access, manipulate, and visualize freely available geospatial data from several national agencies and universities without a browser.\nThe dataset has two data layers reflecting data quality at the pixel level: FparLai_QC and FparExtra_QC. FparLai_QC indicates the quality of the LAI/FPAR algorithm execution. The main situations where data quality may be impacted are: 1) if there are dense canopies, reflectances become saturated and may not properly represent changes in canopy properties or 2) the sun-sensor geometry is collected badly/is too uncertain. If either of these cause the main algorithm to not work properly, then a backup algorithm is used. The best result is the main method being used with no saturation, but if the main method is able to be used despite saturation, this data is still considered “good, very useable.” Cases where a pixel is not able to be produced using either method are also indicated. This information and more can all be found in FparLai_QC, represented as a bit-string. FparExtra_QC includes extra information that could be impacting quality, such as snow/ice presence, aerosol levels, more specific cloud aspects, and land information, also represented as a bit-string. These bit-string variables provide quality information for both FPAR and LAI measurements. Fill values are used within the FPAR and LAI data when biophysical estimates are not able to be generated by an algorithm, or these situations may also be seen represented as missing values, both of which could impact the results of data analysis. In the data for the regions we work with here, only None values are present for FPAR and LAI, which we drop from the data for our tutorial.\nUseful data quality links for further exploration:\n\nThe ArcGIS MODIS-VIIRS Python Toolbox can be used to help decode the data quality layers.\nAdditional information on issues with data by sensor, satellite, and collection version is available by NASA.\nThe user guide also contains more in-depth on the data quality information overviewed here. The data quality information above was summarized from this guide."

    "section": "Use Case Examples",
    "text": "Use Case Examples\n\nSummary\nLet’s now focus on the Lacandon Jungle. Here, we show use case examples for FPAR and LAI during two time periods of interest, 2010 to 2012 and 2020 to 2022. We also include time series plots to show how the FPAR and LAI change day to day over time.\nThis analysis is useful to evaluate whether jungle productivity and area over time have spatially changed. FPAR is a proxy variable for productivity, as it measures the ratio of light entering a photosynthetic system to the amount of light absorbed and reflected in that system. LAI captures changes in tree canopies over time and the potential for gas exchange and light absorption. For a more complete analysis of productivity, LAI can be evaluated alongside FPAR to understand the potential for light absorption versus the true rate of absorption. Differences between LAI and FPAR could be calculated to identify areas of low LAI and high FPAR -- indicating highly efficient canopies -- or high LAI and low FPAR -- indicating less efficient canopies. These calculations are beyond the scope of our notebook though and not illustrated here. FPAR and LAI can also be used to identify areas of deforestation through time.\nThese tools can be used by a number of stakeholders including resource managers, climate scientists, and concerned citizens. Anyone interested in understanding how vegetation and its productivity is changing over time or space might use FPAR and LAI. Outputs from mapping and plotting satellite observations may be used in conservation, resoration, climate models, resource management, or policy evaluation.\n\n\nFPAR in Lacandon Jungle\nLet’s define the time periods of interest and select the band name:\n\n# Select FPAR band name/variable\ngee1 = gdat.filter(ee.Filter.date('2010-11-01', '2012-11-01')).select('Fpar').mean() # select for time period of interest 1\ngee2 = gdat.filter(ee.Filter.date('2020-11-01', '2022-11-01')).select('Fpar').mean() # select for time period of interest 2\n\nNow, let’s create a basemap, add the layer for the mean FPAR from November 2010 to November 2012, and add the layer for the mean FPAR from November 2020 (left) to November 2022 (right):\n\n# Create basemap with spatial parameters for Lacandon Jungle\nMap = geemap.Map(center = [16.75, -91.59522999999996], zoom = 10)\n\n\n# Define palette\npalette = ['#fffff9', '#d7eba8', '#addd8e',\n          '#78c679', '#41ab5d', '#238443', '#005a32']\n\n# Define visual parameters\nvisParams = {'bands': ['Fpar'], #

view map\n\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s make an interactive time series map for FPAR from November 2010 (left) to November 2022 (right):\n\n# Create basemap with spatial parameters for Lacandon Jungle\nFPARMap = geemap.Map(center = [16.75, -91.59522999999996], zoom = 9)\n\n\n# Import collection of images from 2010 to 2022\ncollection = gdat.filter(ee.Filter.date('2010-11-01', '2022-11-01')).select('Fpar')\n\n# Set first image in collection of images from 2010 to 2022\nfirst_image = collection.first()\n\n# Add layer with first image\nFPARMap.addLayer(first_image, visParams, \"FPAR (%) in Lacandon Jungle from 2010 to 2022\")\n\n# Add all other images in collection of images from 2010 to 2022\nimage = collection.toBands()\n\n# Add layer with all other images\nFPARMap.addLayer(image, {}, \"Time series\", False)\n\n# Add labels \nlabels = collection.aggregate_array(\"system:index\").getInfo()\n\n# Add time slider\nFPARMap.add_time_slider(collection, visParams, labels = labels, time_interval = 1)\n\n# Add color legend\nFPARMap.add_colorbar_branca(colors = colors, \n                        vmin = vmin, \n                        vmax = vmax)\n\nFPARMap # view map\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLAI in Lacandon Jungle\nNow, we repeat this same process for Leaf Area Index!\nWe will be using the same time periods of interest, but need to reselect the band and recalculate the means for LAI:\n\n# Select LAI band name/variable\ngee3 = gdat.filter(ee.Filter.date('2010-11-01', '2012-11-01')).select('Lai').mean() # select for time period of interest 1\ngee4 = gdat.filter(ee.Filter.date('2020-11-01', '2022-11-01')).select('Lai').mean() # select for time period of interest 2\n\nWe will use the same palette as before, but will set new visual parameters to adjust for now working with LAI:\n\n# Define visual parameters\nvisParams2 = {'bands': ['Lai'], #

view map\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nFPAR is a parameter for modeling ecosystem productivity, and climate and land cover changes (like deforestation) affects FPAR variation (Peng et al. 2012). Here, we see little change between the two time periods on a broad level, but when zoomed in to random pixels we see slight changes in small areas. This applies to both FPAR and LAI and both the jungle and desert.The aggregated mean FPAR plots for the periods of interest show that, at randomly-selected points, the percentage observed typically increases from 2010 - 2012 to 2020 - 2022. While grassroots and community-led afforestation efforts have occured in the last decade to protect and preserve forest area (Soberanes 2018), we cannot assign changes in FPAR variation to land cover without introducing and controling for meteorological variables like temperature and accumulated precipitation, to consider disturbances like drought.\nWhen looking at LAI averaged over our two year period of 2010-2012 vs. the two year period of 2020-2022, we do not see any major differences. This could imply that the aforementioned afforestation efforts in the last decade either had no discernable major effects or that the tail end of the aforemented deforestion from 2000 to 2012 was less intense and allowed some recovery. We could extend these theories to further analysis by taking averages over more time periods (other two year periods, or longer periods encompassing our current periods) and seeing if any major differences are visible. If data quality was impacting the results, perhaps using longer time period averages could help mitigate these effects.\nWe do not calculate the difference in LAI and FPAR, but a user could use the maps to identify areas with high LAI and low FPAR or low LAI and high FPAR. Next steps for a more complex analysis would be to run these raster algebra calculations and re-plot."

    "text": "Chihuahuan Desert\nLet’s now focus on the Chihuahuan Desert, one of the most diverse deserts in the world.\n\n\n\nThis area is of interest because desert ecosystems are sensitive indicators of climate change due to the fact that even moderate changes in temperature and precipitation can have a large effect on ecosystem services and physical resources (Chihuahuan Desert Network I&M Program 2011). Here, you can inform your own analysis of changes in FPAR and LAI following the same steps for our analysis of the Lacandon Jungle.\n\n\nFirst, set the region of interest as the Chihuahuan Desert:\n\n# Create two regions of interest\nPOI_desert = ee.Geometry.Point(-106.506416, 31.767759) # point for Chihuahuan Desert\n\n\nFPAR Visualization of Chihuahuan Desert¶\nCreate data frame to use for data visualization:\n\n# Create data frame for FPAR variable in Chihuahuan Desert \nfparD = gdat.select('Fpar') # select FPAR band name/variable\nfpar_tsD = fparD.getRegion(POI_desert, scale).getInfo() # extract data\ndf_fparD = pd.DataFrame(fpar_tsD).dropna() # save data frame\n\n# Tidy data frame\nheaders_1 = df_fparD.loc[0] # extract headers\ndf_fparD = pd.DataFrame(df_fparD.values[1:], columns = headers_1) # add headers\nprint(df_fparD) # view data frame with headers\n\n# Convert time to datetime\ndf_fparD['datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(df_fparD['time'], unit = 'ms')\n\n0             id   longitude   latitude           time Fpar\n0     2002_07_04 -106.495277  31.755445  1025740800000    9\n1     2002_07_08 -106.495277  31.755445  1026086400000   10\n2     2002_07_12 -106.495277  31.755445  1026432000000    9\n3     2002_07_16 -106.495277  31.755445  1026777600000    9\n4     2002_07_20 -106.495277  31.755445  1027123200000    8\n...          ...         ...        ...            ...  ...\n1872  2022_12_19 -106.495277  31.755445  1671408000000   11\n1873  2022_12_23 -106.495277  31.755445  1671753600000   10\n1874  2022_12_27 -106.495277  31.755445  1672099200000   10\n1875  2022_12_31 -106.495277  31.755445  1672444800000    9\n1876  2023_01_01 -106.495277  31.755445  1672531200000   10\n\n[1877 rows x 5 columns]\n\n\nNow, let’s make a time series plot:\n\n# Plot time series for FPAR variable in Chihuahuan Desert \nplt.figure(figsize = (10, 6), dpi = 300) # create figure; set size and resolution (dpi)\nplt.plot(df_fparD['datetime'], df_fparD['Fpar']) # add data to plot\nplt.title('Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation in Chihuahuan Desert (FPAR), 2002 to 2022', fontsize = 14) # add title to plot\nplt.xlabel('Year', fontsize = 12) # add x label to plot\nplt.ylabel('FPAR (%)', fontsize = 12) # add y label to plot\n\nText(0, 0.5, 'FPAR (%)')\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd let’s make a histogram plot:\n\n# Plot histogram for FPAR variable in Chihuahuan Desert\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (10, 6), dpi = 300) # create figure; set size and resolution (dpi)\nn, bins, patches = ax.hist(x = df_fparD['Fpar'], bins = 'auto') # add histogram to plot\nplt.title('Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) in Chihuahuan Desert, 2002 to 2022', fontsize = 14) # add title to plot\nplt.xlabel('FPAR (%)', fontsize = 12) # add x label to plot\nplt.ylabel('Count', fontsize = 12) # add y label to plot\nax.yaxis.set_minor_locator(AutoMinorLocator()) # set automatic tick selection for y-axis\nax.xaxis.set_minor_locator(AutoMinorLocator()) # set automatic tick selection for x-axis\nax.tick_params(which = 'major', length = 7) # set major ticks\nax.tick_params(which = 'minor', length = 4) # set minor ticks\n\n\n\n\nFrom our time series and histogram we see that FPAR in the desert is on average much lower than the jungle. It is seemingly seasonal with some variablility. The range is smaller than in the jungle. The data have a small right tail but fairly well distributed.\n\n\nLAI Visualization of Chihuahuan Desert\nNow, we repeat this same process for Leaf Area Index!\nFirst, create data frame to use for data visualization:\n\n# Create data frame for LAI variable in Chihuahuan Desert \nlaiD = gdat.select('Lai') # select LAI band name/variable\nlai_tsD = laiD.getRegion(POI_desert, scale).getInfo() # extract data\ndf_laiD = pd.DataFrame(lai_tsD).dropna() # save data frame\n\n# Tidy data frame\nheaders_2 = df_laiD.loc[0] # extract headers\ndf_laiD = pd.DataFrame(df_laiD.values[1:], columns = headers_2) # add headers\nprint(df_laiD) # view data frame \n\n# Convert time to datetime\ndf_laiD['datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(df_laiD['time'], unit = 'ms')\n\n0             id   longitude   latitude           time Lai\n0     2002_07_04 -106.495277  31.755445  1025740800000   2\n1     2002_07_08 -106.495277  31.755445  1026086400000   2\n2     2002_07_12 -106.495277  31.755445  1026432000000   2\n3     2002_07_16 -106.495277  31.755445  1026777600000   2\n4     2002_07_20 -106.495277  31.755445  1027123200000   2\n...          ...         ...        ...            ...  ..\n1872  2022_12_19 -106.495277  31.755445  1671408000000   1\n1873  2022_12_23 -106.495277  31.755445  1671753600000   1\n1874  2022_12_27 -106.495277  31.755445  1672099200000   1\n1875  2022_12_31 -106.495277  31.755445  1672444800000   1\n1876  2023_01_01 -106.495277  31.755445  1672531200000   1\n\n[1877 rows x 5 columns]\n\n\nNow, let’s make a time series plot:\n\n# Plot time series for LAI variable in Chihuahuan Desert \nplt.figure(figsize = (10, 6), dpi = 300) # create figure; set size and resolution (dpi)\nplt.plot(df_laiD['datetime'], df_laiD['Lai']) # add data to plot\nplt.title('Leaf Area Index in Chihuahuan Desert, 2002 to 2022', fontsize = 14) # add title to plot\nplt.xlabel('Year', fontsize = 12) # add x label to plot\nplt.ylabel('Leaf Area Index (m²/m²)', fontsize = 12) # add y label to plot\n\nText(0, 0.5, 'Leaf Area Index (m²/m²)')\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd let’s make a histogram plot:\n\n# Plot histogram for LAI variable in Chihuahuan Desert \nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (10, 6), dpi = 300) # create figure; set size and resolution (dpi)\nn, bins, patches = ax.hist(x = df_laiD['Lai'], bins = 'auto') # add histogram to plot\nplt.title('Leaf Area Index in Chihuahuan Desert, 2002 to 2022', fontsize = 14) # add title to plot\nplt.xlabel('Leaf Area Index (m²/m²)', fontsize = 12) # add x-axis to plot\nplt.ylabel('Count', fontsize = 12) # add y label to plot\nax.yaxis.set_minor_locator(AutoMinorLocator()) # set automatic tick selection for y-axis\nax.xaxis.set_minor_locator(AutoMinorLocator()) # set automatic tick selection for x-axis\nax.tick_params(which = 'major', length = 7) # set major ticks\nax.tick_params(which = 'minor', length = 4) # set minor ticks\n\n\n\n\nFrom our time series and histogram we see that LAI in the desert is on average much lower than the jungle. It is seemingly seasonal with less variablility.

    "text": "Many species in modern times are faced with the risk of extinction due to global human activity. According to the International Union and Conservation of Nature (IUCN), “More than 41,000 species are threatened with extinction. That is still 28% of all assessed species.” [1]. Increased extinction and loss of biodiversity can have severe ecological, economic, and cultural impacts. Cardinale et al.’s deep dive into biodiversity and ecosystem services research conclude consensus statements that biodiversity loss reduces ecological communities’ efficiency, stability, and productivity. Ecosystem services productivity reductions can have a negative impact on ecosystem economics [2]. Additionally, cultures worldwide have strong ties to local flora and fauna, much of which now face extinction risk. Improving understanding of extinction risk is ecologically, economically, and culturally important.\nWildlife scientists have been working to understand what ecological traits of vertebrates predict threat level, and what common risk factors drive those threat level rates. Munstermann et al. investigate what terrestrial vertebrate functional groups are most at risk of extinction threat and find that cave dwelling amphibian, arboreal quadrupedal mammals, aerial and scavenging birds, and pedal squamates are at high risk [3]. This knowledge can help inform policies and practices with the goal to decrease threats of extinction of wildlife. However, less comprehensive research has been done to conduct similar analyses on marine species.\nIn recent years, the waters surrounding the Hawaiian Islands have been exposed to ecological changes due to mass coral bleaching events, El Nino events, and pollution. Rapidly changing marine ecosystems may pose a threat to Hawaiian fish. Fish hold significant cultural value in Hawaii, and many local people rely on seafood as a major source of protein. However, approximately 72% of fish in Hawaii present in FishBase have been evaluated by the IUCN and have sufficient data to be assessed. Here I run a small-scale analysis to investigate Hawaiian fish ecological traits – such as endemism, size, and reef-association – to predict a binary status on the IUCN red list and predict which unevaluated fish species in Hawaii may be threatened.\n\nData\n\nFor my analyses I use the IUCN Red List data accessed via the IUCN Red List API [1] and package rredlist [4]. Consistent with Munstermann et al., living species listed as ‘Vulnerable’, ‘Endangered’, or ‘Critically Endangered’ were categorized as ‘Threatened’. Living species listed as ‘Least Concern’ and ‘Near Threatened’ were categorized as ‘Nonthreatened’ [3]. Extinct species were not evaluated in this analysis. The IUCN Red List data are limited in that many marine species have not been listed yet or have been identified as too data deficient to be evaluated. The lack of data on elusive fish may introduce bias into the model.\nFish ecological data were accessed from FishBase [5] via package rfishbase [6]. Different species in the FishBase data were originally described by different people, possibly leading to errors or biases. Measurement errors in length may be present, as there are various common ways to measure the length of a fish. The species recorded in FishBase may be biased towards fish with commercial value.\n\nMethods\n\nHere I run a logistic regression with a categorical binary response variable of ‘Threatened’ or ‘Nonthreatened’ on species length, coral reef association, and endemism.\nI included length in the model because previous research show that species of extreme sizes have higher risk of extinction. Ripple et al. “found that the probability of being threatened was positively and significantly related to body mass for birds, cartilaginous fishes, and mammals” [7]. While body mass is not the same as length, the FishBase data set had few weight entries and many length entries, and sample size was already limited. Several mass coral bleaching events have occurred in Hawaii in recent decades causing ecosystem disruption [8]. Here I consider if reef-associated fish are more likely to be threatened that fish that are not reef-associated. Last, endemic species – species that are native to a region and occur only in that region – are known to be at high risk of extinction.\n\nResults & Discussion\n\n\nData exploration:\n\n1.

However, when the outliers are removed, we still see a positive correlation with fish length and probability of threat with the 50% probability mark remaining just over 400 cm (p-value = 2e^-16). When we compute the odds ratio, we see that there is an exponential relationship between the length and the odds of a species being threatened. Odds of being threatened increase more at large lengths.\nConfusion Matrix:\n\n\n\n\nTbl 7.

Endemicity is significantly influencing the model at alpha = 0.90 (p-value = 0.0707). Coral reef association is not significantly impacting the model (p-value = 0.9175).\n\n\nPredicting Probability – Solving for p\nIn this model, the smallest fish in the data set – Melamphaes danae at 2.30 cm – has a probability of being threatened of 0.012. The largest fish in the data set – Rhincodon typus at 1700 cm – has a probability of being threatened of 0.99.\nHere I use the model to predict the probabilities of being threatened for unlisted fish. The top five most vulnerable unranked species under this model are:\n\n\n\n\nTbl 9.

Additionally, not all listed species had every piece of information, and missing data were removed. With missing data removed, the sample became small. It is possible that endemism plays a bigger role in threat risk than illustrated here by the model. Points of concern with this model include disproportionate data in both the threat level and endemism, and high false negative rates in binary prediction. Future analyses could investigate other potential explanatory variables such as metrics measuring fishing pressure, life cycle characteristics, and range. Additionally, future analyses could expand the area of interest to all of the tropics.\n\nReference\n\n[1] “IUCN,” IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

I earned my bachelor’s degree in Biology in 2020 from Iowa State University with a curriculum focus on animal ecology. During my undergraduate studies, I sought out opportunities to connect animal ecology with my passion for marine conservation. I took hands-on marine coursework at the University of Hawaii at Hilo, California State University Monterey Bay, and the University of Southern Mississippi’s Gulf Coast Research Laboratory.\nAfter graduating, I completed a 400-hour Animal Behavior Fellowship at the Virginia Aquarium & Marine Science Center. During the fellowship, I implemented the use of Zoo Monitor - a behavior tracking tool - to monitor harbor seal and American crow behavior. Additionally, my undergraduate capstone project assessed using new technologies (autonomous recording units and Raven Pro sound analysis software) to replace traditional field techniques when monitoring quail coveys. I became enthusiastic about data science when processing data from Zoo Monitor and Raven Pro. My long-term goal is to use data science to inform effective marine wildlife conservation and fisheries management.\nMy interests include:\n\nMarine & wildlife conservation\nRemote sensing & geospatial ecology\nFisheries sustainability\nEnvironmental Justice\n\n\n\n\nMy Hobbies!\n\nWhat do I do outside of the office and classroom? I love hiking, biking, swimming, and generally spending time outdoors. You can frequently catch me reading a book, and it’s most likely a mystery/thriller novel (find me on Goodreads!) I spend a lot of time in the kitchen cooking and baking – I picked up these two hobbies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Last, I dabble in digital illustration & graphic design. I have been selling prints and stickers since 2017.\n\n\nI grew up in the state of Iowa, but I’ve moved around a lot in my adult life! I participated in multiple National Student Exchange programs, and I moved around for internships and fellowships. Check out all the places I’ve lived since I started college in 2016 and relatively how long I lived there:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap made using package leaflet and data from: https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities\n\n\n\nWhat’s Next for Me?\n\nRight now I am focusing on finishing my Master’s degree and anticipate graduating in June 2023. I will be looking to start work next summer as a data scientist! Broadly, I hope to find a role where I can blend my creative and quantitative talents to contribute to an organization or research group focused on wildlife conservation or fisheries sustainability. I am ideally looking for jobs in Washington, Oregon, California or Hawaii."

I like to use creative and quantitative talents in parallel, and the balance between the two has ebbed and flowed over time. \n## Art and Science\n\nAt the time of writing this, I am a master's student studying environmental data science at UC Santa Barbara (read my full bio here), but I am also a self-taught digital artist. Science and art have both played integral roles in my life over the past 6 years, and recently I have been exploring ways to integrate the two. In the past, these two realms of interest have been separate, but I have found that my art can supplement environmental science or vice versa to elevate communication.\n\nI began experimenting in digital illustration and design in 2017, and learned in my own time how to use Adobe Photoshop and Inkscape. Over time, I have progressed to primarily use Procreate and Canva. Additionally, I am an amateur photographer and love to photograph the natural world using a Canon t6i and Adobe Lightroom software.\n\nBelow are some examples of my artwork in science.\n\nI am currently working on a capstone project modeling habitat suitability for kelp cultivation in the Santa Barbara Channel. I designed a hex sticker for our group. (Unfamiliar with hex stickers? Check out [these data science hex stickers](https://github.com/rstudio/hex-stickers) created by others.)\n\n![](hex_sticker.png)\n\n\n```{css}\n{{< video src=\"fish_vid.mp4\" >}}\n```\n\n\nIn 2022, I assisted with a social media campaign by [The LENA Project](https://www.thelenaproject.org/) to provide monthly information and suggestions on environmental related topics. Here are two of the designs I created for this campaign.\n\n![](Food%20Waste.jpg)\n\n![](Earth%20Hour.jpg)\n\nIn 2021, I participated in (as well as volunteered for) [Prompt for the Planet \\*Chapter 2](https://www.promptfortheplanet.com/) -- an initiative to create art and write poetry to raise awareness about our changing planet.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"780\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://promptfortheplanetarchive.omeka.net/items/show/45\" title=\"The Hurricane's Eye on Prompt for the Planet\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\nIn 2020, my art was sourced by [The Lutrinae](https://thelutrinae.com/2021/02/aquarium-volunteers-await-reopening/) in an article about the Monterey Bay Aquarium reopening after shutting down during the pandemic.\n\n\n```{=html}\n\\<iframe width=\"780\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://thelutrinae.com/2021/02/aquarium-volunteers-await-reopening/\" title=\"The Lutrinae\"\\>\\</iframe\\>\n```\n\n\nI use photography as a way to document traveling and share my love for ecology and the natural world.\n\nAdditionally, all of my blog posts feature my own illustrations.\n\n",

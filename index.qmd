<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p>

A little bit about me:

I am a master's student studying Environmental Data Science in the [Bren School of Environmental Science & Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I am passionate about **marine and wildlife conservation**, and I hope to build a career using data science tools to solve environmental problems.

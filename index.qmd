<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p>

A little bit about me:

I recently earned a Master of Environmental Data Science degree from the [Bren School of Environmental Science & Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I am passionate about sustainability and conservation, and I hope to build a career using data science tools to solve environmental problems.

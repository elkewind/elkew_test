## Full Bio

<h4>Biography</h4>

I am a recent graduate of the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I earned a **master's degree in Environmental Data Science (MEDS)**. I also hold a BS in Biology from the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Iowa State University.

Passionate about leveraging data science solutions to address environmental challenges, **I am focused on applying my skills in geospatial analysis, environmental modeling, machine learning, and data visualization to the fields of natural resource management and sustainable food production.**

During my time at the Bren School, I completed a capstone project in collaboration with UCSB researchers and Ocean Rainforest Inc., developing a data pipeline for kelp forest modeling to inform restoration and aquaculture efforts. Prior to that, I gained valuable experience working with the Janke Lab and the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, where I assessed new technologies for monitoring local wildlife.

Beyond my core areas of interest, I am an animal ecology nerd with a deep commitment to ocean conservation, climate solutions, and environmental justice. **I am driven to build a career as a data scientist dedicated to finding innovative environmental solutions that contribute to a sustainable future for all.**

With my interdisciplinary background and strong skill set, I am ready to make an impact in the field of environmental data science, bridging the gap between scientific research, technological advancements, and practical conservation strategies.

## Hobbies

<h4>My Hobbies!</h4>

What do I do outside of the office and classroom? I love walking, biking, swimming, and generally spending time outdoors. You can frequently catch me reading a book, and it's most likely a mystery/thriller novel (find me on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/95038298-elke-windschitl)!) I spend a lot of time in the kitchen cooking and baking -- I picked up these two hobbies during the COVID-19 pandemic shut down. Last, I dabble in digital illustration, graphic design, and photography. I have been selling prints and stickers since 2017. Much of my artwork has environmental themes. All of the photographs, illustrations, and icons found my website are my own.

## Homes

<h4>My Homes</h4>

I grew up in the state of Iowa, but I've moved around a lot in my adult life! I participated in multiple National Student Exchange programs, and I moved around for internships and fellowships. Check out all the places I've lived since I started college in 2016 -- size indicates relatively how long I lived there:

## What's Next

<h4>What's Next for Me?</h4>

I am excited to start my career as an environmental data scientist! Broadly, I hope to find a role where I can bring technical solutions to environmental challenges and contribute to an organization focused on natural resource management or sustainable food production. I am ideally looking for jobs in Santa Barbara, San Diego, or remote opportunities.

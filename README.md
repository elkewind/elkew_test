# Personal Quarto Data Science Website
### elkewind.github.io 

## Summary
This is a personal data science website made with quarto. Here you can find out more about me, see my resume, and view examples of my work. This website was built in Quarto. R and Python are used in coding examples. HTML, CSS, SCSS, and Observable JavaScript are sprinkled throughout to aid with styling.

## Background
I am a recent graduate of the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I earned a masterâ€™s degree in Environmental Data Science (MEDS). I also hold a BS in Biology from the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Iowa State University.

Passionate about leveraging data science solutions to address environmental challenges, I am focused on applying my skills in geospatial analysis, data visualization, environmental modeling, and machine learning to the fields of natural resource management and sustainable food production.

During my time at the Bren School, I completed a capstone project in collaboration with UCSB researchers and Ocean Rainforest Inc., developing a data pipeline for kelp forest modeling to inform restoration and aquaculture efforts. Prior to that, I gained valuable experience working with the Janke Lab and the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, where I assessed new technologies for monitoring local wildlife.

Beyond my core areas of interest, I am an animal ecology nerd with a deep commitment to ocean conservation, climate solutions, and environmental justice. I am driven to build a career as a data scientist dedicated to finding innovative environmental solutions that contribute to a sustainable future for all.

With my interdisciplinary background and strong skill set, I am ready to make an impact in the field of environmental data science, bridging the gap between scientific research, technological advancements, and practical conservation strategies.

This is a short podcast by myself and Lewis White where we debate using nudging and AI for climate solutions. We chose sides for each topic at random. This podcast was created for a final assignment for EDS 242 Ethics and Bias in Environmental Data Science -- a course in UCSB's Master's of Environmental Data Science curriculum taught by Dena Montague. Intro music by [Bonfire Records](https://bonfirerecords.com/) and moderation by Jessica French.
